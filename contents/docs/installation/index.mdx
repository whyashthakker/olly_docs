## How Olly Works

Olly functions as a powerful system with two key components:

1. **Olly (the "body")**: This is our software interface, which you can purchase for a one-time fee of $49. This grants you lifetime access to Olly's features and updates.

2. **Language Model API (the "brain")**: Olly requires integration with an external API to function. This API processes language tasks and powers Olly's responses.

Your one-time payment covers Olly itself, but not the ongoing costs of the language model API. You have two options for the API:

- Use a third-party service like OpenAI (requires a separate subscription)
- Set up a local Ollama integration (free, but requires some technical setup)

## Supported Browsers

Olly is compatible with:

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Any Chromium-based browser (e.g., Brave, Opera)

## Next Steps
