### Step 4: Handle Security Warnings
When you try to open the application, macOS will display security warnings because the app isn't signed by an identified developer. Here's how to handle these warnings:

#### If you see "olly cannot be opened ..."

1. Click "Cancel" on the initial warning
2. Open System Settings and navigate to "Privacy & Security"
3. Scroll down to the Security section where you'll see a message: "olly was blocked to protect your Mac"
4. Click the "Open Anyway" button

#### If you see "Open olly?" warning
1. A new dialog will appear asking "Open olly?"
2. The warning will state: "Apple is not able to verify that it is free from malware that could harm your Mac or compromise your privacy"
3. Click "Open Anyway" if you trust the source

### Step 5: Grant Necessary Permissions
The app may request certain permissions to function properly:
1. You may be asked to allow Olly to update or delete other applications
2. Toggle the permission switch to ON for Olly
3. If prompted that "olly will not be able to update or delete other applications until it is quit", you can click "Later" or "Quit & Reopen" as needed

### Step 6: Launch Chrome with Olly
When you launch Olly, it will check if Chrome is running:
1. If Chrome is already running, you'll see a prompt: "Chrome is currently running. Do you want to close it and launch with unthrottled parameters?"
2. Click "Yes" to close Chrome and relaunch it with optimized settings for Olly extension

### Step 7: Verifying Installation
1. After clicking "Yes", Chrome should launch automatically with the unthrottled parameters
2. You may see a notification in Chrome that "Olly was prevented from modifying your Mac" - this is normal
3. Your Chrome should now be running with enhanced performance settings and the Olly extension installed

## Next Steps
Now that you've successfully installed Olly on your Mac, you can proceed to set up and configure the Auto Commenter feature for LinkedIn automation. This will allow you to engage with LinkedIn content automatically while you browse the web.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during installation:

* **Extraction problems**: Try using a different extraction tool or download the file again
* **Security warnings persisting**: Ensure you're following all steps in the security section above
* **Chrome not launching properly**: Try manually closing all Chrome windows and then launching Olly again
* **Permission issues**: Make sure you're logged into your Mac with an administrator account
