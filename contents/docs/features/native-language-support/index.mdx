## Post Native Language Support

### What is Post Native Language Support?
The "Post Native Language" feature automatically generates comments in the language of the original post when enabled. This functionality helps maintain linguistic consistency throughout conversations and improves engagement with international audiences.

**Example:** If someone creates a post in Japanese, enabling this feature would automatically generate responses or comments in Japanese rather than in another language like English.

### How It Works
When Post Native Language is enabled:

1. Olly analyzes the language of the original post
2. Automatically detects the native language being used
3. Generates comments in that same language
4. Maintains context and cultural nuances
5. Ensures seamless multilingual conversations

## Who Will This Feature Help?

### 1. Global Journalists
International reporters can connect with diverse audiences by engaging with reader comments in their native languages and responding to sources in multiple countries without translation delays. This helps them build credibility with local communities, gather diverse perspectives for stories, and maintain authentic connections across cultural boundaries.

### 2. Multinational CEOs
Business leaders benefit from communicating directly with international teams and engaging with customers in various markets. This feature enables them to build rapport with global stakeholders, deliver consistent messaging across languages, and demonstrate cultural respect through native language engagement.

### 3. International Educators
Professors can enhance their impact by responding to student questions in their native languages and making educational content more accessible globally. This helps create inclusive learning environments, build meaningful connections with international students, and expand their teaching influence across linguistic boundaries.

### 4. Diplomatic Officials
Diplomats can strengthen relations by communicating policy positions in multiple languages and engaging directly with citizens of various nations. This feature helps them build trust through linguistic respect, navigate complex international conversations, and demonstrate cultural competence through language.

### 5. Global Nonprofit Leaders
Humanitarian leaders can amplify their impact by connecting with beneficiaries in their own languages and sharing mission updates with global supporters. This enables them to build trust in diverse communities, coordinate international teams more effectively, and create inclusive dialogue around important causes.
