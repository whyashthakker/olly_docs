#### If you see "olly cannot be opened ..."

1. Click "Cancel" on the initial warning
2. Open System Settings and navigate to "Privacy & Security"
3. Scroll down to the Security section where you'll see a message: "olly was blocked to protect your Mac"

#### If you see "Open olly?" warning
1. A new dialog will appear asking "Open olly?"
2. The warning will state: "Apple is not able to verify that it is free from malware that could harm your Mac or compromise your privacy"
3. Click "Open Anyway" if you trust the source


### Step 5: Grant Necessary Permissions
The app may request certain permissions to function properly:
1. You may be asked to allow Olly to update or delete other applications

1. If Chrome is already running, you'll see a prompt: "Chrome is currently running. Do you want to close it and launch with unthrottled parameters?"
2. Click "Yes" to close Chrome and relaunch it with optimized settings for Olly extension


### Step 7: Verifying Installation
1. After clicking "Yes", Chrome should launch automatically with the unthrottled parameters
2. You may see a notification in Chrome that "Olly was prevented from modifying your Mac" - this is normal
3. Your Chrome should now be running with enhanced performance settings and the Olly extension installed
