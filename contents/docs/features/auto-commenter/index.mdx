## Before You Begin

To use the Auto Commenter feature in the background while you browse, you must first install the full Olly application on your Mac. This allows Olly to run continuously and engage with supporting social media's platforms even when you're not actively on the social media site.

→ **[Follow our Mac Installation Guide here](/docs/installation/mac)**

If you've already installed the Olly app, you can proceed with configuring the Auto Commenter below.

## Important Information Before Setup

### 1. LLM Provider Requirement

⚠️ **Auto Commenter only supports the Olly API** and does not work with any other LLM provider. This is because other LLM providers do not provide the necessary permissions to perform background activity required for automated engagement.

### 2. Platform Support

⚠️ **Auto Commenter now supports 5 platforms:**
- Instagram
- LinkedIn
- TikTok
- Twitter
- Facebook

### Step 5: Configure LinkedIn Integration

1. You will be redirected to the Olly dashboard: `https://www.olly.social/dashboard/auto-commenter/config`
2. **Select platforms** where you want to use Auto Commenter feature
3. Review your License Key (should be automatically filled)
4. You can copy the license key using the button if needed
5. The system will confirm that this license is valid for the configuration

**Additional Features Available:**

- **Use Your Existing Brand Voice:** You can now use your existing brand voice or you can create a new brand voice if you don't have the existing one in the Auto Commenter so that your responses will feel more human-generated and authentic to your personal or company style.

- **Promote Your Product:** Include product promotion in automated interactions to naturally showcase what you offer while engaging with content.
  - **Product Details:** Provide details about what you're promoting. This information will be used to generate relevant comments that seamlessly incorporate your product or service.

### Step 6: Content Configuration

#### Set Engagement Limits:

⚠️ You can set a default maximum of **10 comments** and **10 likes** per run. Additionally, you can add up to **3 target keywords (3 hashtags)** to focus your engagement.

#### Important - Balancing Comments Between Feed and Keywords:

⚠️ You need to distribute your 10 comments between the general feed and your target keywords.

**Example:**
- If you add 4 comments on the general feed and you are targeting 3 keywords, you have 6 comments remaining
- This means you can only add 2 comments per keyword (6 comments ÷ 3 keywords = 2 comments per keyword)
- You must adjust the 10 comment count between feed engagement and keyword targeting

**If you select "Use Custom Prompt", you can:**
- Enter your custom instructions for comment generation
- Add signature text to appear at the end of each comment

**Complete the Configuration:**
- On the final page, click **"Save Configuration"**
