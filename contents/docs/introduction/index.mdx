## How Olly Works

Olly functions like a powerful body, but to truly excel, it needs a brain. This is where Large Language Models (LLMs) come into play. To unlock Olly's full potential, users need to connect it to an LLM such as OpenAI's GPT models or Anthropic's Claude AI.

These advanced language models serve as the intelligence behind Olly, enabling it to generate:

- Engaging comments
- Compelling posts
- Concise summaries
- Accurate virality predictions

By leveraging these LLMs, Olly ensures that the content it produces is not only relevant and engaging but also tailored to your unique voice and brand.
