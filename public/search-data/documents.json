The Auto Commenter allows you to automatically engage with LinkedIn content while you browse the web, saving you time and increasing your social media presence.\n\n> **Prefer video instructions?** [Watch our video guide to Auto Commenter setup](https://youtu.be/HzIC8kpePwU) (opens in new window)\n\n***\n\n## Quick Links\n\n### Installation\n\n**Mac Installation Guide**\\\nBefore configuring, make sure to install the Olly application on macOS.\\\n[→ Go to Mac Installation Guide](/docs/installation/mac)\n\n### Configuration\n\n**Auto Commenter Setup**\\\nLearn how to configure the Auto Commenter for LinkedIn engagement.\\\n[→ Go to Configuration Guide](/docs/features/auto-commenter/configuration)\n\n### Support\n\n**Help Center**\\\nGet assistance and troubleshooting tips for the Olly Auto Commenter.\\\n[→ Go to Help Center](/docs/support)\n\n***\n\n## Before You Begin\n\n### ⚠️ Important\n\nTo use the Auto Commenter feature in the background while you browse, you must first install the full Olly application on your Mac. This allows Olly to run continuously and engage with supporting social media's platforms even when you're not actively on the social media site.\n\n→ **[Follow our Mac Installation Guide here](/docs/installation/mac)**\n\nIf you've already installed the Olly app, you can proceed with configuring the Auto Commenter below.\n\n***\n\n## Important Information Before Setup\n\n### 1. LLM Provider Requirement\n\n⚠️ **Auto Commenter only supports the Olly API** and does not work with any other LLM provider. This is because other LLM providers do not provide the necessary permissions to perform background activity required for automated engagement.\n\n### 2. Platform Support\n\n⚠️ **Auto Commenter now supports 5 platforms:**\n\n* Instagram\n* LinkedIn\n* TikTok\n* Twitter\n* Facebook\n\n***\n\n## Configuring Olly Auto Commenter\n\n### Step 1: Open Olly Extension\n\nClick on the Olly icon in your Chrome extensions toolbar to open the extension popup.\n\n***\n\n### Step 2: Enable and Sync\n\nIn the Olly popup window:\n\n1. Toggle the **\"Enable\"** switch to ON\n2. Toggle the **\"Sync\"** switch to ON\n\n![Sync Icon](/images/features/auto-commenter/step1.png)\n\n***\n\n### Step 3: Access Settings\n\nClick on the **\"Settings\"** gear icon on the right side of the popup.\n\n![Settings Icon](/images/features/auto-commenter/step2.png)\n\n***\n\n### Step 4: Set Up Auto Commenter\n\n1. In the settings menu, find and click on the **\"Auto Commenter\"** option\n2. Click on **\"Setup Auto Commenter\"** button\n\n![Auto Commenter Settings](/images/features/auto-commenter/step3.png)\n\n***\n\n### Step 5: Configure LinkedIn Integration\n\n1.

Review your License Key (should be automatically filled)\n4. You can copy the license key using the button if needed\n5. The system will confirm that this license is valid for the configuration\n\n**Additional Features Available:**\n\n* **Use Your Existing Brand Voice:** You can now use your existing brand voice or you can create a new brand voice if you don't have the existing one in the Auto Commenter so that your responses will feel more human-generated and authentic to your personal or company style.\n\n* **Promote Your Product:** Include product promotion in automated interactions to naturally showcase what you offer while engaging with content.\n  * **Product Details:** Provide details about what you're promoting. This information will be used to generate relevant comments that seamlessly incorporate your product or service.\n\n![Dashboard Auto Commenter](/images/features/auto-commenter/step4.png)\n\n***\n\n### Step 6: Content Configuration\n\n#### Set Engagement Limits:\n\n⚠️ You can set a default maximum of **10 comments** and **10 likes** per run. Additionally, you can add up to **3 target keywords (3 hashtags)** to focus your engagement.\n\n#### Important - Balancing Comments Between Feed and Keywords:\n\n⚠️ You need to distribute your 10 comments between the general feed and your target keywords.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* If you add 4 comments on the general feed and you are targeting 3 keywords, you have 6 comments remaining\n* This means you can only add 2 comments per keyword (6 comments ÷ 3 keywords = 2 comments per keyword)\n* You must adjust the 10 comment count between feed engagement and keyword targeting\n\n![LinkedIn Configuration - Content Tab](/images/features/auto-commenter/step6.png)\n\n**If you select \"Use Custom Prompt\", you can:**\n\n* Enter your custom instructions for comment generation\n* Add signature text to appear at the end of each comment\n\n**Complete the Configuration:**\n\n* On the final page, click **\"Save Configuration\"**\n\n![LinkedIn Configuration - Content Tab](/images/features/auto-commenter/step6-1.png)\n\n***\n\n### Step 7: Sync Your Configuration\n\n1. Return to the Chrome extension\n2.

Click on the **\"Settings\"** gear icon\n2. Check the **\"Auto Commenter\"** tab to confirm your configuration appears\n\n![Verify Configuration](/images/features/auto-commenter/step9.png)\n\n***\n\n## Feature Benefits\n\n* **Time Saving:** Automate engagement on LinkedIn posts while you browse the web\n* **Increased Visibility:** Regular engagement helps boost your profile's visibility\n* **Consistent Presence:** Maintain an active presence even when you're busy\n* **Smart Responses:** AI-generated comments that are contextually relevant\n* **Customizable:** Set your own engagement parameters and comment style\n\n***\n\n## Who Will This Feature Help?\n\n### 1. Social Media Managers\n\nEasily manage LinkedIn engagement across multiple accounts while focusing on other important tasks\n\n### 2. Marketers & Content Creators\n\nMaintain consistent engagement without spending hours manually commenting on posts\n\n### 3. Business Professionals\n\nBuild your personal brand on LinkedIn with minimal time investment\n\n### 4. Job Seekers\n\nIncrease your visibility within your professional network when looking for opportunities\n\n***\n\n## Using Auto Commenter in Background Mode\n\n### Do You Want to Use Auto Commenter in the Background?\n\nTo use Olly Auto Commenter in the background (while you continue browsing other websites), you need to have the full Olly application installed on your Mac.\n\n* **If you haven't installed Olly yet:** Follow our [Mac Installation Guide](/docs/installation/mac) first\n* **If you've already installed Olly:** You can proceed to activate background mode below\n\n***\n\n### Activating Auto Commenter on LinkedIn\n\n#### Step 9: Navigate to Social Media Platform Where You Want to Use Auto Commenter\n\n1. Navigate to Social Media in your browser\n2. The Olly popup icon should appear on the right side of your screen\n3. Hover over it and click on the **\"Auto Engage\"** button\n4. A small window will open in the top right corner and will begin the auto commenting process\n\n![LinkedIn with Olly Activated](/images/features/auto-commenter/step10.png)\n\n***\n\n#### Step 10: Background Operation\n\n1. You can minimize the small window and continue browsing the web\n2. The Auto Commenter will engage on your behalf in the background\n3. You can click the **\"Stop auto comment\"** button at any time to halt the process\n4. When the process completes or is stopped, the window will automatically close\n\n![Background Operation](/images/features/auto-commenter/step11.png)\n\n***\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter any issues:\n\n* **Extension not appearing:** Verify Chrome launched with the unthrottled parameters\n* **Configuration not syncing:** Try toggling the Sync button off and on again\n* **Auto Commenter not starting:** Ensure you're logged into LinkedIn and refresh the page\n* **Comments not posting:** Check your daily limits and ensure your LinkedIn account is in good standing\n* **Background mode not working:** Make sure the full Olly app is installed and running\n\nFor additional support or feature requests, please contact support at **support@olly.social** or visit our [Help Center](/docs/introduction).\n\n***\n"

This grants you lifetime access to Olly's features and updates.\n\n2. **Language Model API (the \"brain\")**: Olly requires integration with an external API to function. This API processes language tasks and powers Olly's responses.\n\nYour one-time payment covers Olly itself, but not the ongoing costs of the language model API. You have two options for the API:\n\n* Use a third-party service like OpenAI (requires a separate subscription)\n* Set up a local Ollama integration (free, but requires some technical setup)\n\n## Supported Browsers\n\nOlly is compatible with:\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Microsoft Edge\n* Any Chromium-based browser (e.g., Brave, Opera)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter completing the installation:\n\n* Explore Olly's features through the extension interface.\n* Refer to our comprehensive documentation for advanced usage instructions.\n* Join the Olly community for tips, tricks, and support.\n\nIf you have any questions or need assistance with setup, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.

    "content": "![Banner](/images/banner.png \"Olly Mac Installation\")\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis guide walks you through the process of installing the Olly application on macOS. Installing the full Olly app is required to use advanced features like Auto Commenter in the background while you browse the web.\n\n<CardGrid>\n  <Card subtitle=\"Installation\" title=\"Mac Setup Guide\" description=\"Complete instructions for installing Olly on macOS.\" href=\"/docs/installation/mac\" />\n\n  <Card subtitle=\"Windows\" title=\"Windows Setup Guide\" description=\"Instructions for Windows users.\" href=\"/docs/installation/windows\" />\n\n  <Card subtitle=\"Support\" title=\"Help Center\" description=\"Get assistance with installation issues.\" href=\"/docs/introduction\" />\n</CardGrid>\n\n## Installing Olly on macOS\n\n### Step 1: Download the Application\n\n1. Visit [www.olly.social/downloads](https://www.olly.social/downloads) in your web browser\n2. Click the **Download Now** button in the green button\n3. You will see the download start (typically as a `output.zip` file of approximately 9.8 MB)\n\n![Download Page](/images/features/mac-install/step1.png)\n\n### Step 2: Extract the Application\n\n1. Locate the downloaded `output.zip` file in your Downloads folder\n2. Double-click to extract it or right-click and select \"Extract\"\n3. A folder named \"output\" will be created containing the Olly application (approximately 10 MB)\n\n![Extracted Folder](/images/features/mac-install/step2.png)\n\n### Step 3: Move to Applications Folder\n\n1. After extraction, an installer window will appear showing the Olly app icon on the left and the Applications folder icon on the right\n2. Drag the Olly app icon (teal square with robot icon) to the Applications folder icon (blue folder with the \"A\" symbol)\n3. This action installs Olly in your Applications folder, making it easier to find and launch\n\n![Move to Applications](/images/features/mac-install/step-move.png)\n\n### Step 4: Handle Security Warnings\n\nWhen you try to open the application, macOS will display security warnings because the app isn't signed by an identified developer. Here's how to handle these warnings:\n\n#### If you see \"olly cannot be opened ...\"\n\n1. Click \"Cancel\" on the initial warning\n2. Open System Settings and navigate to \"Privacy & Security\"\n3. Scroll down to the Security section where you'll see a message: \"olly was blocked to protect your Mac\"\n4. Click the \"Open Anyway\" button\n\n![Security Warning](/images/features/mac-install/step31.png)\n![Privacy Settings](/images/features/mac-install/step32.png)\n![Privacy Settings](/images/features/mac-install/step33.png)\n\n#### If you see \"Open olly?\" warning\n\n1. A new dialog will appear asking \"Open olly?\"\n2. The warning will state: \"Apple is not able to verify that it is free from malware that could harm your Mac or compromise your privacy\"\n3. Click \"Open Anyway\" if you trust the source\n\n### Step 5: Grant Necessary Permissions\n\nThe app may request certain permissions to function properly:\n\n1. You may be asked to allow Olly to update or delete other applications\n2. Toggle the permission switch to ON for Olly\n3. If prompted that \"olly will not be able to update or delete other applications until it is quit\", you can click \"Later\" or \"Quit & Reopen\" as needed\n\n### Step 6: Launch Chrome with Olly\n\nWhen you launch Olly, it will check if Chrome is running:\n\n1. If Chrome is already running, you'll see a prompt: \"Chrome is currently running. Do you want to close it and launch with unthrottled parameters?\"\n2. Click \"Yes\" to close Chrome and relaunch it with optimized settings for Olly extension\n\n### Step 7: Verifying Installation\n\n1. After clicking \"Yes\", Chrome should launch automatically with the unthrottled parameters\n2. You may see a notification in Chrome that \"Olly was prevented from modifying your Mac\" - this is normal\n3. Your Chrome should now be running with enhanced performance settings and the Olly extension installed\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you've successfully installed Olly on your Mac, you can proceed to set up and configure the Auto Commenter feature for LinkedIn automation. This will allow you to engage with LinkedIn content automatically while you browse the web.\n\n→ [Configure Olly Auto Commenter](/docs/features/auto-commenter)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter any issues during installation:\n\n* **Extraction problems**: Try using a different extraction tool or download the file again\n* **Security warnings persisting**: Ensure you're following all steps in the security section above\n* **Chrome not launching properly**: Try manually closing all Chrome windows and then launching Olly again\n* **Permission issues**: Make sure you're logged into your Mac with an administrator account\n\nFor additional support, please contact support at support@olly.social or visit our [Help Center](/docs/introduction).\n\n***\n"
