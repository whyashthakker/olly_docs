The Auto Commenter allows you to automatically engage with LinkedIn content while you browse the web, saving you time and increasing your social media presence.\n\n<CardGrid>\n  <Card subtitle=\"Installation\" title=\"Setup Guide\" description=\"Step-by-step instructions for installing the Olly Chrome extension.\" href=\"/docs/features/auto-commenter/installation\" />\n\n  <Card subtitle=\"Configuration\" title=\"Auto Commenter Setup\" description=\"Learn how to configure the Auto Commenter for LinkedIn engagement.\" href=\"/docs/features/auto-commenter/configuration\" />\n\n  <Card subtitle=\"Support\" title=\"Help Center\" description=\"Get assistance and troubleshooting tips for the Olly Auto Commenter.\" href=\"/docs/support\" />\n</CardGrid>\n\n## Part 1: Installing Olly Chrome Extension\n\n### Step 1: Download the Application\n\n1. Visit [www.olly.social/downloads](https://www.olly.social/downloads) in your web browser\n2. Click the **Download Now** button in the green button\n3. You will see the download start (typically as a `output.zip` file of approximately 9.8 MB)\n\n![Download Page](/images/features/mac-install/step1.png)\n\n### Step 2: Extract the Application\n\n1. Locate the downloaded `output.zip` file in your Downloads folder\n2. Double-click to extract it or right-click and select \"Extract\"\n3. A folder named \"output\" will be created containing the Olly application (approximately 10 MB)\n\n![Extracted Folder](/images/features/mac-install/step2.png)\n\n### Step 3: Move to Applications Folder\n\n1. After extraction, an installer window will appear showing the Olly app icon on the left and the Applications folder icon on the right\n2. Drag the Olly app icon (teal square with robot icon) to the Applications folder icon (blue folder with the \"A\" symbol)\n3. This action installs Olly in your Applications folder, making it easier to find and launch\n\n![Move to Applications](/images/features/mac-install/step-move.png)\n\n### Step 4: Handle Security Warnings\n\nWhen you try to open the application, macOS will display security warnings because the app isn't signed by an identified developer. Here's how to handle these warnings:\n\n#### If you see \"olly cannot be opened ...\"\n\n1. Click \"Cancel\" on the initial warning\n2. Open System Settings and navigate to \"Privacy & Security\"\n3. Scroll down to the Security section where you'll see a message: \"olly was blocked to protect your Mac\"\n4. Click the \"Open Anyway\" button\n\n![Security Warning](/images/features/mac-install/step31.png)\n![Privacy Settings](/images/features/mac-install/step32.png)\n![Privacy Settings](/images/features/mac-install/step33.png)\n\n#### If you see \"Open olly?\" warning\n\n1. A new dialog will appear asking \"Open olly?\"\n2. The warning will state: \"Apple is not able to verify that it is free from malware that could harm your Mac or compromise your privacy\"\n3. Click \"Open Anyway\" if you trust the source\n\n### Step 5: Grant Necessary Permissions\n\nThe app may request certain permissions to function properly:\n\n1. You may be asked to allow Olly to update or delete other applications\n2. Toggle the permission switch to ON for Olly\n3. If prompted that \"olly will not be able to update or delete other applications until it is quit\", you can click \"Later\" or \"Quit & Reopen\" as needed\n\n### Step 6: Launch Chrome with Olly\n\nWhen you launch Olly, it will check if Chrome is running:\n\n1. If Chrome is already running, you'll see a prompt: \"Chrome is currently running. Do you want to close it and launch with unthrottled parameters?\"\n2. Click \"Yes\" to close Chrome and relaunch it with optimized settings for Olly extension\n\n### Step 7: Verifying Installation\n\n1. After clicking \"Yes\", Chrome should launch automatically with the unthrottled parameters\n2. You may see a notification in Chrome that \"Olly was prevented from modifying your Mac\" - this is normal\n3. Your Chrome should now be running with enhanced performance settings and the Olly extension installed\n\n## Part 2: Configuring Olly Auto Commenter\n\n### Step 8: Open Olly Extension\n\nClick on the Olly icon in your Chrome extensions toolbar to open the extension popup.\n\n![Olly Extension Icon](/images/step1-extension-icon.png)\n\n### Step 9: Enable and Sync\n\nIn the Olly popup window:\n\n1.

This API processes language tasks and powers Olly's responses.\n\nYour one-time payment covers Olly itself, but not the ongoing costs of the language model API. You have two options for the API:\n\n* Use a third-party service like OpenAI (requires a separate subscription)\n* Set up a local Ollama integration (free, but requires some technical setup)\n\n## Supported Browsers\n\nOlly is compatible with:\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Microsoft Edge\n* Any Chromium-based browser (e.g., Brave, Opera)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter completing the installation:\n\n* Explore Olly's features through the extension interface.\n* Refer to our comprehensive documentation for advanced usage instructions.\n* Join the Olly community for tips, tricks, and support.\n\nIf you have any questions or need assistance with setup, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.

These components are particularly useful when you want to break down a process or tutorial into easy-to-follow stages.\n\n## Steps\n\nTo create a step-by-step guide in your MDX, you can use the following structure:\n\n<Step>\n  <StepItem title=\"Install Node.js\">\n    Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org).\n\n    To verify the installation, run the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    node -v\n    ```\n  </StepItem>\n\n  <StepItem title=\"Install Dependencies\">\n    After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n  </StepItem>\n\n  <StepItem title=\"Run the Project\">\n    Start the development server:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n\n    You can access the application at:\n\n    ```bash\n    http://localhost:3000\n    ```\n  </StepItem>\n</Step>\n"
