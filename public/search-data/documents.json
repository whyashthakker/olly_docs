Most of the essential project settings can be configured within the `settings` folder.\n\n## Settings\n\nThis section provides the core settings for your documentation site, such as defining the site's URL, site icon and title.\n\n```tsx showLineNumbers\nexport const url = \"\"; // The URL for your documentation site\nexport const siteicon = \"\"; // Icon displayed next to the site name in the header\nexport const sitename = \"\"; // Title of your documentation site\n```\n\n## Google Tags\n\nThis section allows you to integrate Google Tag Manager into your documentation project. You can add your GTM code and configure whether it's connected.\n\n```tsx showLineNumbers\nexport const gtm = \"\"; // Add your Google Tag Manager code here\nexport const gtmconnected = true; // Set to true if GTM is connected, otherwise set to false\n```\n\n## Search Engine\n\nConfigure essential SEO settings to ensure your documentation site is optimized for search engines. This includes meta descriptions, keywords and social media sharing details like images and alt text.\n\n```tsx showLineNumbers\nexport const description = \"\"; // Description of your documentation site for SEO\nexport const keywords = [\"\", \"\"]; // List of SEO keywords for your documentation site\nexport const urlimage = \"\"; // The URL of the image used when sharing on social media)\nexport const imagealt = \"\"; // Alt text for shared images, helpful for screen readers\nexport const twitterhandle = \"\"; // Your company’s Twitter handle for social sharing\n```\n\n## Footer Branding\n\nThe footer settings allow you to customize the company information displayed at the bottom of the site. You can add the company name and the URL that the name will link to.\n\n```tsx showLineNumbers\nexport const companyname = \"\"; // The company name displayed in the copyright section\nexport const companylink = \"\"; // The URL your company name should link to\n```\n\n## General Layout\n\nThe layout settings control the appearance and functionality of various elements of the documentation site, such as branding, the right sidebar, feedback options, table of contents, and scroll-to-top functionality.\n\n```tsx showLineNumbers\nexport const branding = true; // Set to true to display our branding elements\nexport const rightsidebar = true; // Set to true to enable the right sidebar with feedback, table of contents and scroll-to-top\nexport const feedbackedit = true; // Control to enable/disable feedback on GitHub\nexport const tableofcontent = true; // Control to enable/disable the generated table of contents\nexport const totopscroll = true; // Control to enable/disable scroll-to-top button\n```\n\n## Github Control\n\nIf your MDX files are hosted on GitHub, you can configure the project to load documents directly from there. This option can be useful for syncing documentation updates directly with your repository.\n\n```tsx showLineNumbers\nexport const loadfromgithub = false; // Set to true to load your MDX documents directly from GitHub\n```\n\n## Project Structure\n\n<CardGrid>\n  <Card title=\"Navigation\" href=\"/docs/navigation\" icon=\"alignJustify\" variant=\"small\" description=\"Creating your navigation\" />\n</CardGrid>\n"
